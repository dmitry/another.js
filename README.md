another.js
==========

Another (http://thesaurus.com/browse/another) javascript framework, based on Backbone with full integration with Ruby on Rails, first of all ORM and ODM.

===

Main MVP of another.js is an admin panel, that has the following features:

* customizable;
* auto-generated by default;
* implementation of the all abilities of the system;
* add more.

===

Main ideas behind this framework:

* SEO compatipable using #! and pushState (hash change should work on both: old and modern browsers)
* Form data binding to the model (resource) to be able to send files (should work as iframe send of the form on old browsers, and on the modern browsers FormData object should be used while XHR sends data)
* ActiveRecord and Mongoid support
* Validation errors parsing
    * Support nested attributes
    * Client-side
    * Server-side
* Nested attributes using both possibilities:
    * Embedded `has many` and `has one`
    * Associated outside models (using id reference)
* Form builder with ability to automatic assign values to inputs and get nested associated models and build fields from them (formFor and fieldsFor)


Made of
=======

* backbone (https://github.com/documentcloud/backbone)
* underscore
* jquery.form or jQuery-File-Upload (https://github.com/malsup/form/, https://github.com/blueimp/jQuery-File-Upload)
* HAML (https://github.com/netzpirat/haml_coffee_assets)
* Coffeescript
* JS.Class (https://github.com/jcoglan/js.class)
* ...

Influence by
============

* Joosy
* Batman.js
* Backbone.js


API (WIP)
=========

AbstractView
* load - can have multiple functions that can be loaded asynchonically
* before - function that invokes before render and after load
* after - after `remove` invoked (called from `remove`)

* remove - removes bindings and current $el

### Router

Support nested queries inside hash, hash and history API

* [TODO]

### Layout

* page
* widgets

### Page

* @layout - sets layout
* layout - sets layout, alternative to @layout

* layout - layout, default value is 'default'
* previous - `{page, position}`: previous page object, position is x/y of previous screen that loaded when user clicks back
* params

* @scroll - function, that scrolls screen to position
  
### Widget

* parent - sets when layout, page or widget creates nested widget

### Form

* `constructor` - set ajaxForm, adds method depends on resource persistence
* `submit` - submits form

### Templater

* `@get(name, locals)` - get template by name from JST and pass it to constructor
* `constructor(template, locals)`
* `render(locals)` - render template
* `@insert` - insert to DOM (uniqueId from underscore to generate ID for data-another-insert)

### Collection extended from Backbone.Collection

### Resource extended from Backbone.Model

* `@hasMany` - embedded collection
* `@hasManyExternal` - outside associated proxy collection
* `@hasOne`
* `@hasOneExternal`
* `@belongsTo`
* `@hasManyIds` - embedded ids, but external resources associated through proxy collection
* `@hasAndBelongsToMany`


## Unsorted Ideas

* user spec for testing (jasmine), may be add integration testing using phantom.js
* add generators for model, collection,  page, layout, widget, route, scaffold


Basic idea is:

`Router` is getting `page`, `page` can constist of `layout` and `widgets` (`page`, `layout` and `widget` is inherited from a `view`). Any `view` can have a `form`. `Collection` can have one or multiple `resource`s (`model`s).

Model can have different association types: embedded and external (embedded have embed object and external have id reference(s) to a models).

Form features:
* nested association
* error output from: client and server (nested attribute dependent server error output).
* bind and fill form and form partials (only with this functionality it's possible to post files). - what does mean... I think it should not be implemented, but anyway as an idea it can have it's own life.
